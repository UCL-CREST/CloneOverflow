A related topic is beginners who post (at times dangerously) misleading tutorials online on topics they actually know very little about. Think php/mysql tutorials written 10+ years after mysql_* functions were obsolete, or the recent regex tutorial that got posted the other day on HackerNew (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14846506).

They rarely take more than a few minutes to write, and it's usually harder to explain what they're doing in plain English.
Where something is large enough to worth the effort of licensing then it's far too big for a snippet. In those cases I create a GitHub project (with a license) and link to it.
I'd be wary of increased IP controls - I doubt there is value they could add to snippets, but they could create significant barriers to contributors, which would hurt the site."

If it is a student, I don't want to just hand out the answer; they will learn nothing from that. If, on the other hand, it's somebody looking for best practices or a clever trick, I'm not too worried about giving out the solution. In this case, chances are much higher that the person asking the question will go ""Ahh, yes, of course!"" and understand the question, whereas some students are more likely to mindlessly copy-paste the answer.

However, it is also a competitive site, so if your answer requires too much work to incorporate, it won't get accepted or upvoted. As a result, some people—I'm guilty of this myself, I'm sure—will hand out an answer willy-nilly that might solve the problem at hand, but in the long run be a disservice to the person asking.

But I digress: My point is that it's sometimes better to describe a solution rather than just hand off a code snippet. However, since your project seems to pertain to copyright issues, I suppose that's not relevant to you.

it's hard to edit and see output in so but website like jsfiddle , jsbin provide nice interface where code editing and output is easy to do.

outer thing is in so lot of code snippets doesnt work because some users doesnt add libraries like angular , jquery i think it's better if so can identify and ask user to auto inject relevant libraries "

Regardless, since most of the code I write is specifically to answer a given question and having full knowledge of the license system used by StackOverflow, it is entirely unimportant to concern myself with licensing the code provided. Also, code from MSDN documentation which I sometimes adapt and modify for answers are already in the public domain so it makes no sense re-licensing it.

On the matter of deprecation, I almost entirely use .NET which has got different versions of the framework. Therefore, code deprecation is not often a problem since what is deprecated on one version of the framework may be the only way of solving a given problem on an older version of the framework.
I may also have to add that questions I tend to answer are about how to solve general coding problems so they are not usually subject to deprecation."

Patents, copyright issues and so on - it's all just annoying. We're there to have fun and to share knowledge with people. 

In the early days, the internet used to be full of free-for-all stuff without any licenses. Because of that, it was a fantastic tool to share knowledge and information on a vast scale. The remnant of this, open source, couldn't have existed without this!

Personally, I believe this ""intellectual property"" drive of the last decade is completely overrated. If you make something _substantial_, it's fine to be able to claim some ownership - but on snippets? It's like patenting the stuff you make in your free time in your shed... it doesn't make sense and just adds to the pile of legal bullshit imho."
