SOSnippetFilter is a Python script to automate the process of filtering Stack Overflow Java snippets.

We got a problem that some of the extracted SO snippets are not in Java (sometimes they're only psuedocode). 
We needed to remove them out from the data set in order to avoid bias in the experiment.
